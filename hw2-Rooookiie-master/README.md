# CS150 Databasee HW2 part A: Coding

In homework 2, you need to finish PS3.ipynb.

*Caution: Activity-15.ipynb is recommended to complete but not necessary. What
you need is to fill out the required content of submit.py.*

## Submission Instructions for Problem Set 3

Although Jupyter Notebooks are a very useful tool for interactively playing with SQL queries, it turns out that they make autograding a pain. As a workaround, we’ve included an autograder-friendly submission template file (submit.py) for submitting your work.

For each question, copy and paste your final answer into the appropriate location in the template.

Importantly, comment out your explanations using Python comments!

Please let us know if you're stuck or confused about where to copy your answers.

**Once you’ve copied all of your code into the submission template, you’re ready to upload your code (including submit.py and finished PS3.ipynb)!**

If you have any questions or encounter any issues with the submission process, please let us know!
